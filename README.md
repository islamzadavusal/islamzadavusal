As a seasoned Mobile Developer, I have extensive experience working with Android SDK, Kotlin, Swift, Swift UI, Jetpack Compose, MVVM, MVI, Room DB, Firebase, Retrofit, and Hilt. My technical expertise spans across Clean Architecture, Dependency Injection, Coroutines, REST & SOAP APIs, Push Notifications, and Unit/UI Testing. I thrive on delivering scalable, user-focused applications with efficient performance.
Currently, I lead Android development at Kalem YazÄ±lÄ±m MMC, while also dedicating my spare time to creating innovative mobile apps such as restaurant apps, AI-based chatbots, and e-commerce platforms, all of which are available on my GitHub.
With a passion for continuous learning and staying ahead of industry trends, I am committed to building impactful digital solutions that enhance user experiences.
